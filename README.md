This project was used on a contest named Tubitak.
In this project we use rfid reader and a raspberry pi to controll a website and a door.
File named `run.py` reads from a rfid reader and it checks students from the database.
Overall this project is helping teachers with roll call.

`flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5008`

`python run.py`
